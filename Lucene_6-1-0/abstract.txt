Estimation of the potential impact of dengue vaccination on clinical outcomes in Brazil / Estimativa do impacto potencial com a vacinação contra dengue nos desfechos clínicos no BrasilEstimation of the potential impact of dengue vaccination on clinical outcomes in Brazil / Estimativa do impacto potencial com a vacinação contra dengue nos desfechos clínicos no Brasil
Objective The aim of the current analysis was to measure the public health impact of dengue vaccination in Brazil using a published transmission dynamics model Methods We adapted a mathematical model that represented the transmission dynamics of the four dengue fever serotypes in humans and in the mosquito This compartmental model represents the known characteristics of dengue transmission dynamics host-vector interactions immunological interactions between all four dengue serotypes age structure of the population levels of specific transmission by age seasonality of the disease and growth of the human and vector population Results Our mathematical model showed a 22% CI95% 9-37 reduction of all cases of dengue fever for a smaller scenario routine vaccination at 9 years old and catch-up campaign to 10 years of age and 81% CI95% 67-89 in the largest scenario routine vaccination at 9 years old and catch-up campaign to 40 years of age over a 5-year period For the 10-year impact we estimated a 22% CI95% 12-39 reduction in the smaller scenarioand a 92% CI95% 80-95 reduction in the larger scenario This reduction in the number of cases would lead to significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations Up to 233509 CI95% 148534 - 331849 and 739378 CI95% 604386  894072 hospitalizations would be prevented over a 5-year and 10-year period respectively with the larger vaccination program Conclusion This analysis indicates that within expected variations a national dengue vaccination program in Brazil would lead to significant public health benefits by reducing dengue infections and hospitalizationsAU
